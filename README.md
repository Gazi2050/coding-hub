# 1# MY Project Features

# Course Selection: 
I can select courses from a list, and the system will keep track of my selections, ensuring that I don't exceed the allowed credit hours. It also calculates the total price of the selected courses.

# Credit Hour Management:
 The project provides a clear overview of my remaining credit hours, making it easy for me to see how many more courses I can add. This feature helps me make informed decisions when choosing courses.

# User-Friendly Interface:
 The project has a user-friendly interface that displays course details, including course names, descriptions, prices, and credit hours. This makes it convenient for me to browse and select the courses that interest me.
